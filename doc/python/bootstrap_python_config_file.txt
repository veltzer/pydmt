The idea is to have a file called "bootstrap.py" which will be in the "config"
folder and will specify things that we need to install *SO THAT WE COULD
IMPORT CONFIG/PYTHON.PY*.

This is, of course, only if config/python.py import stuff, which it usually does not
and that is why in the majority of projects, we don't need bootstrap.py.
