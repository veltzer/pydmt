Pydmt should *only* collect the "requires" field from config/python.py

Once it did not! it collected about 6 or 7 different fields and concatenated them. Why? why would pydmt be
interested in such minutia? It should not.

The API between pydmt and the programmers should be *simple and easy to describe*.

This is a main design goal.
