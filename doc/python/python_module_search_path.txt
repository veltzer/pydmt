We add the current folder to sys.path (PYTHONPATH) because we want python to be
able to find the "config" module in the "config" folder.
In order to do this we must add the current working folder to the path
since in python it is not by default in the path (what is in the path is the folder
from which the toplevel application is run which is not the same thing).
