examples of specific modules
pydmt -> make_requires
	it seems that we don't need pydmt at all because in workflow integration
	we install it as part of a "bootstrap" phase.
	But really we do need it as part of our build tools because we don't
	always work as a workflow.
	We didn't feel the problem so actutely because we had pydmt installed
	as part of the system/user python and not the virtual env python.
