Not used
setup_requires
	what is required to run python setup.py for this package.
	these things may not be required for running.

Used:
config_requires
	what is required for the config/*.py subfolder.
dev_requires
	what is required for a person to maintain this product.
	stuff that is neede for build or test should not be present
	in this list only.
make_requires
	what is required for the Makefile to function.
	this is currently take to mean "build_requires"
	which means what is needed for both make and pydmt
	but this really needs to be separated into
	"pydmt_requires" and "make_requires"
	curreny everything is in "make_requires"
install_requires
	what is required on the target system to install this package
	(may or may not be needed for runtime)
test_requires
	what is required to do testing, coverage anaysis.

future things which are not yet implemented:
run_requires
	what is needed to run the code locally or at the target machine
pydmt_requires
	packages that pydmt needs to run
build_requires
	what is neede for the build which is not covered by 'make_requires'
	and 'pydmt_requires'.
	example of this is "pydmt" itself which is needed to run the entire build.

examples of specific modules
pydmt -> make_requires
	it seems that we don't need pydmt at all because in workflow integration
	we install it as part of a "bootstrap" phase.
	But really we do need it as part of our build tools because we don't
	always work as a workflow.
	We didn't feel the problem so actutely because we had pydmt installed
	as part of the system/user python and not the virtual env python.
