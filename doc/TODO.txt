- add to YAML scanning and finding of vscode type schema and
	using it.
- add loading of url.
- add json validation with Coc.
- change version
	then build
	then build again
	somehow the second build still does something
	fix that
- add a plugin system to pydmt.
	pick up all features and builders
	This way we will not need hardcoding of default builders in pydmt/main.py build method
- implement the "clean" method
	just go over all builders, take all targets and remove them.
	The problems is what happens with targets we discover after building?
		write a doc about it.
- support yaml validations
- maybe run sphinx programaticlly instead of via the executable?
- support other template types like jinja2, mustache, string.template (standard library), ...
- cannot do something like:
	$ pydmt build | foo
	get weird errors - take care of that.
- emit logging messages when things are running for easy debugging.
