- why doesnt pydmt notice when config/version.py changes...?
	check that
- make pydmt print what targets it is building.
	(it used to do that)
- support yaml validations
- maybe run sphinx programaticlly?
- support other template types like jinja2, mustache, string.template (standard library), ...
- cannot do something like:
	$ pydmt build | foo
	get weird errors - take care of that.
- emit logging messages when things are running.
