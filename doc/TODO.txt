- maybe run sphinx programaticlly?
- support other template types like jinja2, mustache, string.template (standard library), ...
- today pydmt gets configs from:
	.
	~/.config/pydmt
	/etc/pydmt
	make it take configs also from the installation of pydmt
	so that I could share configs like git etc...
- cannot do something like:
	$ pydmt build | foo
	get weird errors - take care of that.
- emit logging messages when things are running.
