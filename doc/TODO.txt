- change version
	then build
	then build again
	somehow the second build still does something
	fix that
- implement the "clean" method
	just go over all builders, take all targets and remove them.
	The problems is what happens with targets we discover after building?
		write a doc about it.
- support yaml validations
- maybe run sphinx programaticlly?
- support other template types like jinja2, mustache, string.template (standard library), ...
- cannot do something like:
	$ pydmt build | foo
	get weird errors - take care of that.
- emit logging messages when things are running.
