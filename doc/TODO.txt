- cannot do something like:
	$ pydmt_build | foo
	get weird errors - take care of that.
- only print things that fail by default.
- return code of pydmt is always ok even though some targets
	fail.
- currently pydmt prints out an event including doing
	nothing.
	make the standard configure not print anything when there
	is nothing to do.
	make this configurable.
- emit logging messages when things are running.
