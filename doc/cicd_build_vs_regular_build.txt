pydmt once used to distinguish between those two build and even had a flag for it (--dev [true|false]).
This is a bad idea.
What if I have seven itegration environments? You get the idea.

There is no need to distinguish between them since we already have environment variables to do that!
for instance, in github workflows there is an environment variable called `GITHUB_WORKFLOW`.

make can also pick up environment variables.

Pydmt should be clean of those details.
